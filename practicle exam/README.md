  - Classes & Objects  
  - Constructors  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Inheritance  
  - Virtual Functions  
  - Polymorphism  
  - Abstract Classes

## 📂 Programs Included

### 🔹 Program 1: Student Class (Constructor & Array of Objects)
- Created a `Student` class with private attributes:
  - `name`
  - `rollNumber`
- Implemented a **parameterized constructor**
- Demonstrated object creation using an **array of objects**

---

### 🔹 Program 2: Car Class (Encapsulation)
- Created a `Car` class with private attributes:
  - `model`
  - `year`
  - `speed`
- Used **getter and setter methods**
- Demonstrated **data encapsulation**

---

### 🔹 Program 3: Device Inheritance (Abstraction)
- Created a base class `Device` with:
  - `brand`
  - `powerConsumption`
- Derived classes:
  - `Laptop`
  - `Smartphone`
- Implemented device-specific display methods
- Demonstrated **abstraction**

---

### 🔹 Program 4: Device Polymorphism (Virtual Function)
- Added virtual function `calculateDiscount()` in `Device`
- Overridden in:
  - `Laptop`
  - `Smartphone`
- Used an **array of base class pointers**
- Demonstrated **runtime polymorphism**

---

### 🔹 Program 5: Animal Abstract Class
- Created an abstract class `Animal` with:
  - `makeSound()`
  - `move()`
- Derived classes:
  - `Lion`
  - `Fish`
- Used **pure virtual functions**
- Demonstrated polymorphism using base class pointers
